My introduction to <code class=\"language-text\">R</code> came when I took a statistics course in graduate school circa 2008. I was immediately hooked on the complexity and beauty of expressing ideas as code and to create data analyses and software.</p>\n<p>After 15 years working with <code class=\"language-text\">R</code>, in May 2023 I designed and taught my first workshop covering beginner basics of <code class=\"language-text\">R</code> and focusing on examples for <code class=\"language-text\">data wrangling</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">visualization</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">multivariate modeling</code>. The <a href=\"https://creativedatasolutions.github.io/R_programming_for_DS_beginner/\">full course</a> spans 14 hours of material culminating with an introduction to making <code class=\"language-text\">reproducible reports</code> with <code class=\"language-text\">quarto</code> and using <code class=\"language-text\">AI code generation</code> tools.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://creativedatasolutions.github.io/R_programming_for_DS_beginner/\">Go to course</a></h2>\n<p>This course covers the major topics for beginners to get started with R programming for data analysis and visualization.</p>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to get up and running with R using the Rstudio</li>\n<li>Understand R data types and functions</li>\n<li>Use data frame manipulation to wrangle data</li>\n<li>Visualize and plot with ggplot2 and plotly</li>\n<li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>\n<li>Put it all together by creating a reproducible data analysis reports</li>\n<li>Use AI tools to improve your code</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"R programming for Data Science  - A Beginner's Guide","date":"May 03, 2023","description":null,"tags":["R","programming","course","data visualization","multivariate analysis","machine learning"]}},"more":{"nodes":[{"fields":{"slug":"/2023-05-03-R_for_DS_beginner/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 03, 2023","title":"R programming for Data Science  - A Beginner's Guide","description":null,"tags":["R","programming","course","data visualization","multivariate analysis","machine learning"],"thumbnail":"/images/2023-05-03-R_for_DS_beginner_thumbnail.png"}},{"fields":{"slug":"/network_mapping_101/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 30, 2021","title":"Network mapping 101 hands-on course and DAVe in review","description":null,"tags":["R","network analysis","network mapping","data visualization","multivariate analysis","machine learning","preprocessing","statistical analysis","clustering"],"thumbnail":"/images/network_mapping_101_thumbnail.png"}},{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-10-26-pathway-enriched-mapped-networks/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 26, 2021","title":"Pathway enrichment-based network mapping to visualize metabolite evidence for associations with disease","description":null,"tags":["R","network analysis","network mapping","data visualization","pathways"],"thumbnail":"/images/pathway_network.png"}}]},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/network_mapping_101/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Network mapping 101 hands-on course and DAVe in review"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"df7fb1cb-b2cc-5642-8b0d-6a9f04c0f411","previousPostId":"b232400b-a4e7-5622-9e5f-8bb5325a39e1","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1713152521","2841359383"]}
